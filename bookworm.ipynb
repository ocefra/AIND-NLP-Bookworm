    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

It can be used to design conversational agents or _chatbots_ that exhibit complex behavior, but for the purpose of this project, we'll only use it to parse certain kinds of queries.\n",

    "An _intent_ is the goal or purpose of a user's input. Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
    "\n",

Palpatine tantalizes Anakin with secret knowledge of the dark side of the Force, including the power to save his loved ones from dying. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to the planet Utapau to deal with General Grievous, and Yoda travels to Kashyyyk to defend the planet from invasion. Tempting Anakin, Palpatine eventually reveals that he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, saying that only he has the knowledge to save Padm\\u00e9 from dying. Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to Mace Windu, who confronts and subdues the Sith Lord, severely disfiguring him in the process. Fearing that he will lose Padm\\u00e9, Anakin intervenes on Palpatine's behalf and severs Windu's hand, allowing Palpatine to push him out of a window to his death. Anakin pledges himself to Palpatine, who dubs him Darth Vader. Palpatine issues an order for the clone troopers to kill their Jedi commanders and dispatches Vader along with a legion of clones to kill everyone in the Jedi Temple. Vader massacres the remaining Separatist leaders hiding on the volcanic planet Mustafar, while Palpatine addresses the Galactic Senate, transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire and declaring himself Emperor. Having survived the chaos, Obi-Wan and Yoda return to Coruscant and learn of Anakin's treachery.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q**: Now that you have gone through this exercise of designing a system that uses two IBM Watson services, what did you learn? What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: I'll start with the weaknesses. I was very disappointed with the performance of both services (Conversation and Discovery). It is by mere chance that, after endless trials, I finally got a query whose actual answer happens to be at the top of the list. With the system set as instructed in this lesson there is no way any query can get a real answer. The analysis of the question is very coarse: the information extracted from the question is simply insufficient to discriminate between questions that have absolutely nothing in common. The Conversation service parses \"Who is Anakin's mother/father/mentor/pet/friend/...?// Who is Anakin?\" and other infinitely many queries as having intent(s): ['who'], entities: ['Anakin'], and dialogue node: Agent. Adding further entities to Conversation (such as @FamilyMember) is pointless without them being added to Discovery as well, because those would be found in the question but not in the document collection where the answers come from. Moreover, a query does not seem to be able to express the *simultaneous* presence of multiple entities in the candidate text, or to filter by relevance on *all* the entities. As a consequence, the user is limited to querying on one entity at a time. Once we get some results, checking if the actual answer is in there is another thing altogether. This is totally unfeasible programmatically. I had to do it by inspecting the results and cherry-picking by hand the one to return. There is no learning involved, at least as far as Conversation is concerned, and all the \"knowledge\" must be hand-coded. This is a 100% rule-based system. Where is the AI in all this?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the bright side, it is awesome to be able to take advantage of the wealth of resources that Discovery is connected to. Furthermore, setting up a system like this is very fast: in half an hour one may have a basic system up and running.\n",
    "\n",

    "## (Optional) Extensions\n",

    "We have provided a set of sample data files containing Star Wars plot summaries. But as mentioned before, you are free to use your own dataset. In fact, a larger dataset maybe more suitable for use with IBM Watson's NLP services. If you used your own dataset, answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What dataset did you use, and in what ways is it different from the sample files provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: NA\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Either include your dataset in the .zip file or repository you submit, or provide clear instructions on how to obtain the dataset, so that your reviewer can run your notebook or inspect the data to verify your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: NA\n",
